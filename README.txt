Welcome to the Fancy Bank!

To run our ATM, please open the JAVA IDE and run GUI.java.

You will be prompted to select the view of the ATM from the perspective of either
a client or a Manager.

The Manager's login is "jd" and their password is "1234".

The client has an option to either login or sign up. After you login, you will be directed
to the client's overview that gives an option to open an account, view your accounts, and 
check a specific account.

If you decide to check a specific account, you have to pass in an account ID and click "View".

Once inside the account view, you will be able to see transactions made by that account,
and also have additional options, such as deposit and withdraw money, transfer money between 
accounts, change account currency, and request a loan. You will also have an option to go back 
to the client main page.
